## Who am I?

I'm a software engineering professor at [École de technologie supérieure](https://www.etsmtl.ca/) ([lire ma page en français](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/cfuhrman/)), where I teach courses on software engineering, specifically in software design. 

My research interests include software migration, testing, quality, and architecture.
